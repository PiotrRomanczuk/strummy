# PR Manager Agent

## Core Principles

1. **ALWAYS create a new branch** -- never commit directly to `main` or `production`
2. **ALWAYS update Obsidian vault** -- mark task WIP before starting, Done after merge; add PR link as sub-item
3. **ALWAYS run quality gates** before pushing -- `npm run lint && npm test`

---

## Full PR Workflow

### Step 1: Find the task in Obsidian vault

Before any code work, check the vault:

- **Read**: `~/Obsidian/MainCV-Planner/projects/Strummy/Strummy.md` — find the relevant Now item
- **New work not yet listed**: append it to the Now section first
- **Mark task WIP** using Obsidian MCP:
  ```
  obsidian_patch_content("projects/Strummy/Strummy.md", "- [ ] task title", "- [ ] WIP task title")
  ```

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

**Branch naming convention**: `{type}/{short-description}`

Types: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `docs/`, `chore/`

```bash
# Always branch from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode
```

Examples:

- `feature/add-dark-mode`
- `fix/token-refresh-race`
- `test/scheduler-coverage`
- `refactor/split-publish-module`

### Step 3: Develop and Commit

Follow project conventions:

- Commit message format: `type(scope): description`
- No ticket IDs in commits

```bash
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "feat(settings): add dark mode toggle"
```

### Step 4: Run Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

```bash
npm run lint && npm test
```

**DO NOT proceed if any check fails.** Fix issues first.

### Step 5: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin feature/add-dark-mode
```

Create the PR with `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add dark mode toggle" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Add dark mode toggle to settings page
- Detect system preference and allow manual override
- Persist preference in localStorage

## Obsidian Task
Task: projects/Strummy/Strummy.md › Now — Add dark mode toggle

## Test plan
- [ ] Toggle switches between light and dark mode
- [ ] System preference is detected on first visit
- [ ] Preference persists across page refreshes
- [ ] All components render correctly in both modes

```

### Step 6: Update Obsidian vault with PR link

After PR creation, add the PR URL as a sub-item under the WIP task:

```
obsidian_patch_content(
  "projects/Strummy/Strummy.md",
  "- [ ] WIP Add dark mode toggle",
  "- [ ] WIP Add dark mode toggle\n  - PR: <PR_URL>"
)
```

### Step 7: Watch CI Checks

```bash
gh pr checks --watch
```

**MUST PASS**: Lint, TypeScript, Tests, Build.

If checks fail:

1. Fix locally
2. Re-run quality gates
3. Push fixes
4. Re-verify with `gh pr checks --watch`

### Step 8: After Merge -- Update Obsidian vault

Once the PR is merged, mark the task Done:

```
obsidian_patch_content("projects/Strummy/Strummy.md", "- [ ] WIP task title", "- [x] task title")
```

### Step 9: Create Release (if version was bumped)

Version is bumped automatically by the `version-bump.yml` GitHub Action after merge to `main`. No manual action needed in normal cases.

## Vault Integration Rules

### Always Keep Vault Updated

| Event                   | Vault Action                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start working on task   | `obsidian_patch_content` → mark `[ ] WIP`                      |
| Push branch / create PR | Add PR link as sub-item under WIP task                         |
| PR has failing checks   | No vault change; fix CI and re-push                            |
| PR merged               | `obsidian_patch_content` → mark `[x]` Done                     |
| PR closed without merge | Remove WIP marker → restore `[ ]`, add note inline             |
| New work discovered     | `obsidian_append_content("inbox.md", "- [ ] discovered task")` |

### Creating Tasks for Discovered Work

If during PR work you discover additional tasks:

```
obsidian_append_content("inbox.md", "- [ ] [TECH-DEBT] Fix race condition in token refresh (found during add-dark-mode)")
```

---

## Branch Rules

### Never Push Directly To

- `main` -- production branch, only via PR
- `production` -- only via PR from main

### Branch Lifecycle

1. Branch created from latest `main`
2. Work done on branch
3. PR opened against `main`
4. CI checks pass
5. PR squash-merged
6. Branch deleted after merge

### Stale Branch Cleanup

After merge, delete the remote branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete feature/add-dark-mode
```

---

## PR Body Template

Every PR must follow this structure:

**IMPORTANT**: PR descriptions become GitHub Release notes automatically when merged to main. Write comprehensive, user-facing descriptions that document what changed, why, and how to use new features.

```markdown
## Summary

<1-3 bullet points describing the changes in user-facing language>

## Obsidian Task

Task: projects/Strummy/Strummy.md › Now — <task title>

## Changes

- List new features, components, or fixes
- Include file counts and key architectural decisions
- Mention database migrations if applicable

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added and passing (coverage >70%)
- [ ] Integration tests if applicable
- [ ] E2E tests for user journeys
- [ ] Manually tested on local environment
- [ ] Tested on mobile devices

## Database Changes (if applicable)

- [ ] Migration file created: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_description.sql`
- [ ] Migration tested locally
- [ ] RLS policies verified

## Breaking Changes (if applicable)

- List any breaking changes
- Include migration guide for users

## Security Checklist (if applicable)

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation on new endpoints
- [ ] Auth checks on protected routes
- [ ] RLS policies enforced

## Screenshots (for UI changes)

[Add before/after screenshots if UI changes]

### Release Notes Best Practices

Since PR descriptions become release notes, ensure they:

1. **Use user-facing language** -- not technical implementation details
2. **Include "What's Changed"** section with clear feature list
3. **Document breaking changes** prominently
4. **Add migration guides** if schema/API changes
5. **Include screenshots** for UI features

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Full PR workflow in one go
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/short-description
# ... do work ...
npm run lint && npm test
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"
git push -u origin feature/short-description
gh pr create --title "Descriptive title" --body "..."
gh pr checks --watch
# After merge:
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/short-description
# Mark vault task Done
```
