echo "🧩 SMALL COMPONENTS POLICY:"
echo "Always split UI and logic into the smallest reasonable, composable pieces."
echo "• Favor many tiny components over a monolith"
echo "• Extract presentational pieces from containers"
echo "• Co-locate hooks/helpers next to usage (useX.ts, X.helpers.ts)"
echo "• Keep files < 300 LOC and functions < 80 LOC"
echo "• Place tests under __tests__/components mirroring structure"
