# Database Rebuild Playbook

A from-scratch rebuild of the Strummy database, starting minimal (auth + CRUD on
songs / lessons / assignments) and growing **one migration at a time**, folding in
every structural improvement surfaced by the 2026-07 migration + baseline analysis.

This is both the design spec and the working checklist — tick each step as it lands.

## Why we're doing this

`supabase/migrations/` accumulated three mutually-incompatible schema generations
(numbered `001–044`, a 2025 timestamped chain, a 2026 chain). The full chain is
**not runnable on a fresh DB** — duplicate `CREATE TABLE profiles/songs`, and
cross-generation dependencies where later files need columns/tables defined in
another generation. The repo already declared the `supabase/baseline/` Cloud dump
(2026-06-22) the source of truth because prod had drifted via out-of-band DDL.

Rather than migrate the drifted schema, we start clean and **bake the right
foundations in from migration #1** so later subsystems (shadow students,
repertoire, notifications, AI, audit) are designed correctly instead of retrofitted.
The old migrations live in `supabase/migrations_archive/` as historical record.

## Section 1 — Conventions (the "definition of done" for every migration)

Every migration in this rebuild must satisfy this contract. These are the analysis
findings turned into standing rules.

- **Filenames**: full 14-digit `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`. No numeric prefixes,
  no date-only prefixes — both caused lexicographic ordering hazards before. _(M4, M5)_
- **Idempotency**: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`,
  `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before every `CREATE POLICY`, `DO $$ … WHEN duplicate_object`
  guards around `CREATE TYPE`. _(M2)_
- **Time**: every timestamp is `timestamptz`. _(S16 — baseline already clean; keep it)_
- **UUIDs**: `gen_random_uuid()` only. No `uuid-ossp` / `uuid_generate_v4()`. _(S17)_
- **RLS**: enabled on every table. Policies reference `(select auth.uid())`
  (InitPlan-cached, evaluated once) — **never** bare `auth.uid()`. Role checks go
  through the shared helper functions — **never** an inline
  `EXISTS (SELECT … FROM profiles …)` per row. _(S5)_
- **SECURITY DEFINER**: every such function sets `SET search_path = public`
  (or empty + fully schema-qualified names). _(M6)_
- **One `set_updated_at()`**: a single trigger function, reused everywhere. No
  per-table `updated_at` variants. _(S8)_
- **FKs**: `NOT NULL` unless the relationship is genuinely optional. Back an FK with
  an index only where it is actually queried — no speculative indexing. _(S13)_
- **Enums vs lookup tables**: enums only for closed, stable sets (e.g. `music_key`).
  Growth-prone catalogs (notification types, auth event types) become lookup tables. _(S7)_
- **Explicit grants**: every table migration `GRANT`s privileges to `authenticated`
  (and `all` to `service_role`) — RLS scopes _rows_, grants gate _table access_; both
  are required. Self-contained, not reliant on platform default privileges. The
  validation harness omits default-privileges on purpose, so a missing grant fails the gate.
- **No data in migrations**: zero seed rows, zero hardcoded UUIDs/emails, zero backfill
  DML in a schema migration. Seed lives in `supabase/seed.sql` / the `seed-factory` skill. _(M3)_
- **After each migration**: `supabase db reset` (local uwh stack) → regenerate
  `types/database.types.generated.ts` → run the step's gate test → `npm test`. _(A4)_

---

## Section 2 — Phase 1: minimal core (ordered)

Each step is one migration + its gate test. Tables start **minimal** — only the
columns basic CRUD needs — and grow in later phases. That is the whole point.

### Wave 0 — DB-only foundation (no UI)

- [x] **Step 0 — Foundation** &nbsp; `..._foundation.sql`
  - Closed-set enums only: `difficulty_level`, `lesson_status`,
    `assignment_status` (**5 values** — `pending` dropped, it was unused by the app),
    `lesson_song_status` (**unified, includes `slow_tempo` from day one** so the app
    and DB enums never drift). _(S3 root, S7, A3)_
  - `set_updated_at()` — single, `SET search_path`. _(S8)_
  - Role helpers moved to Step 1: `is_admin() / is_teacher() / is_student() /
is_admin_or_teacher()` read `public.profiles`, and Postgres validates SQL function
    bodies at creation, so the table must exist first. _(S1, S5, M6)_
  - **Gate test**: enums present (incl. `slow_tempo`, excl. `pending`); `set_updated_at`
    exists. ✅ passed via `scripts/db/validate-migrations.sh`.

- [x] **Step 1 — profiles + signup** &nbsp; `..._profiles.sql`
  - `profiles`: `id uuid PK DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`,
    `user_id uuid UNIQUE REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` (nullable),
    `email citext UNIQUE`, `full_name / first_name / last_name`, `avatar_url`,
    `notes`, `phone`, flags `is_admin / is_teacher / is_student / is_active
(default true) / is_development`, `created_at / updated_at`.
    **No `user_roles` table. No shadow/parent columns yet.** _(S1, S2, S11, S12)_
  - `handle_new_user()` on `auth.users` → insert profile (`user_id = new.id`, names
    from `raw_user_meta_data`); `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`. This is the cleaned-up
    single version — replaces the ~9 competing rewrites in the old schema.
  - `set_updated_at` trigger; RLS: self read/update (`user_id = (select auth.uid())`),
    admin all.
  - **Gate test**: sign up via local auth → profile auto-created with names populated;
    RLS: a user sees only their own row, service role sees all.

- [ ] **Wave 0 app wiring** (code, no migration)
  - Keep `lib/supabase/{server,client,middleware}.ts` and
    `lib/auth/loadAuthedProfile.ts` (flag-based roles) and `withApiAuth`.
  - Expose `profile.id` from `loadAuthedProfile` so ownership checks can compare
    `profile.id` instead of `auth.uid()` (identity model change). _(A-reconcile)_

### Vertical slices (each: DB → API → UI → tests → **human test gate**)

- [x] **Step 2 — songs (minimal)** &nbsp; `..._songs.sql`
  - `songs`: `id`, `title NOT NULL`, `author`, `level difficulty_level`,
    `key music_key`, `chords`, `short_title`, `ultimate_guitar_link`, `deleted_at`,
    timestamps. Media / tempo / lyrics / AI columns deferred to a later
    "songs: rich metadata" migration.
  - Soft-delete via `deleted_at` (no cascade function yet — added with repertoire).
  - RLS: authenticated read where `deleted_at IS NULL`; insert/update/delete for
    admin/teacher via helpers. _(S13 — index only `title` / `deleted_at` as needed)_
  - **Gate test**: teacher CRUD works; student is read-only; soft-delete hides the row.

- [x] **Step 3 — lessons (minimal)** &nbsp; `..._lessons.sql`
  - `lessons`: `id`, `teacher_id NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles`,
    `student_id NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles`, `scheduled_at timestamptz NOT NULL`,
    `title`, `notes`, `status lesson_status DEFAULT 'scheduled'`,
    `lesson_teacher_number int`, `deleted_at`, timestamps.
    `UNIQUE (teacher_id, student_id, lesson_teacher_number)`.
  - `set_lesson_numbers` trigger — the **single** source of numbering, with an
    advisory lock on `(teacher_id, student_id)` to close the concurrent-insert gap.
    The app must stop computing numbers itself. _(S9, A2)_
  - RLS with the 2026-07-15 IDOR scoping baked in from the start: admin all;
    teacher sees/edits own; student reads own; UPDATE/DELETE scoped to teacher with
    `WITH CHECK`. _(S5)_
  - **Gate test**: create several lessons for a pair → numbers increment `1..n`;
    teacher sees own, student sees own, student cannot update another's lesson.

- [x] **Step 4 — lesson_songs (join)** &nbsp; `..._lesson_songs.sql`
  - `lesson_songs`: `id`, `lesson_id NOT NULL`, `song_id NOT NULL`,
    `status lesson_song_status DEFAULT 'to_learn'`, timestamps.
    `UNIQUE (lesson_id, song_id)`.
  - RLS via lesson ownership (helper + `(select auth.uid())`).
  - **Gate test**: attach a song to a lesson; status moves through all 6 values incl.
    `slow_tempo` without error; visibility inherits the lesson. _(S3 root)_

- [x] **Step 5 — assignments (minimal)** &nbsp; `..._assignments.sql`
  - `assignments`: `id`, `teacher_id NOT NULL`, `student_id NOT NULL`,
    `lesson_id` (nullable), `song_id` (nullable), `title`, `description`,
    `status assignment_status DEFAULT 'not_started'`, `due_date`, `deleted_at`,
    timestamps.
  - RLS: admin all; teacher own; student own but mutations restricted to `status`
    (policy / column-grant); `WITH CHECK` enforces teacher ownership on write.
  - **Gate test**: teacher creates only for own students; student can change only
    `status`; invalid status transition rejected app-side. _(A3)_

- [ ] **Step 6 — app reconciliation + seed** (code + `seed.sql`, no migration)
  - Regenerate `types/database.types.generated.ts`; reconcile hand-written Zod enums
    (`SongStatusEnum`, `AssignmentStatusEnum`) to the DB. _(A3, A4)_
  - Ownership checks compare `profile.id`.
  - Rewrite `supabase/seed.sql` for the new schema (no `user_roles`, new columns; a
    few auth users + profiles + songs + one teacher/student pair). Keep
    `config.toml` `sql_paths = ["./seed.sql"]`. _(M3)_
  - **Gate test**: `supabase db reset` runs clean end-to-end; app dev server signs in
    and lists/creates a song, a lesson, an assignment.

---

## Section 3 — Later-phase backlog

Each item is a future migration + gate test, still obeying Section 1. Designed clean,
not retrofitted:

- **Shadow students & parents** — add `is_shadow`, `invite_email`, `parent_id / is_parent`.
  Independent-PK identity means **no RLS rewrite**. One clean transfer function, not the
  ~25-table blast-radius version. _(S2 fully realized)_
- **Repertoire & progress** — a single `student_repertoire` with **one** shared progress
  enum; **no** `student_song_progress`; `song_status_history` uses the enum, not `text`;
  sync trigger handles the `slow_tempo` mapping. _(S3, S15, S18)_
- **Practice sessions** — `student_id` / `song_id` `NOT NULL`. _(S10)_
- **Notifications** — one coherent design; `entity_id` a single consistent type;
  notification/event _types_ as lookup tables. _(S6, S7)_
- **Auth events / rate limiting / lockout**. _(S7)_
- **Audit / history** — lightweight per-entity history only; **no** partitioned
  `audit_log`, no hand-managed monthly partitions. _(S4)_
- **Rich song metadata, song videos, SOTW, requests, sections** — additive.
- **AI, content production, theory courses** — additive.
- **Integrations** — `api_keys`, `user_integrations`, `webhook_subscriptions`,
  `drive_files` (decide FK vs polymorphic), `spotify_matches`. _(S14)_

## Section 4 — Improvement catalog (traceability)

Every finding from the analysis, mapped to where it is resolved. Nothing is dropped.

### Structural (baseline schema review)

| S9  | Count-based lesson numbering, no lock                               | Step 3 — advisory lock                                 |
| S10 | `practice_sessions` FKs nullable                                    | Practice phase — `NOT NULL`                            |
| S11 | Domains defined but bypassed                                        | Step 1 — `citext` email; drop unused domains           |
| S12 | `student_status` defaults `'archived'`                              | Step 1 — sane defaults (col deferred anyway)           |

| S14 | `drive_files` polymorphic, FK-less                                  | Integrations phase — decide FK                         |
| S15 | `song_status_history` status is `text`                              | Repertoire phase — use enum                            |
| S16 | (Good) all `timestamptz`                                            | Convention — keep                                      |
| S17 | Mixed UUID defaults                                                 | Convention — `gen_random_uuid()` only                  |
| S18 | Double FK on `song_status_history.student_id`                       | Repertoire phase — single FK                           |

## Section 5 — App-layer reconciliation notes

Standing guidance as the schema lands (details in the app map — key files below):

- **Keep the auth foundation**: `lib/supabase/{server,client,middleware}.ts`,
  `lib/auth/loadAuthedProfile.ts` (flag-based roles), `lib/auth/withApiAuth.ts`.
- **One CRUD surface per table**: API route + `handlers.ts` + Zod `*InputSchema`,
  following `app/api/assignments/`. Retire the competing server-action create/edit
  paths for songs (`app/actions/song-form.ts`, `app/actions/song-edit.ts`). _(A1)_
- **Ownership checks compare `profile.id`**, not `auth.uid()` (identity model). _(A-reconcile)_
- **Trust the numbering trigger**: delete the 5 manual `calculateNextLessonNumber` /
  max+1 sites (`app/dashboard/calendar-actions.ts`,
  `app/dashboard/lessons/recurring-actions.ts`, `app/actions/import-lessons.ts`,
  `app/api/calendar-sync/route.ts`, `app/api/lessons/utils.ts`). _(A2)_
- **Standardize response shapes** to named keys (`song`, `songs`, `lesson`), no `data`. _(A5)_
- **Regenerate `types/database.types.generated.ts`** after every migration and reconcile
  the Zod enums in `schemas/`. _(A3, A4)_

## Section 6 — Execution model (multi-agent orchestration)

**Unit of delivery = vertical slice** (one domain, end-to-end). Ship and human-test a
slice before the next begins.

**Slices are strictly sequential — not parallelizable.** The blocker is shared state,
not file conflicts, so worktree isolation does not help:

- One shared local Supabase stack (uwh) — concurrent `supabase db reset` collides.
- One ordered migration chain — later migrations depend on earlier tables/helpers.
- One regenerated type file and one `seed.sql` — two slices both rewrite them.
- One shared app shell (auth, layout, nav).

Real concurrency would need a Supabase branch + isolated DB per slice — overkill for
solo incremental work. So: **one slice at a time, human test gate between slices.**

**Within a slice = a short agent pipeline** with one genuine parallel fan (≤2 agents at
once; no worktrees — sequential hand-off on the same tree):

```
DB agent (supabase-schema-architect)
   → migration + db reset + regen types + RLS/SQL tests        [alone, first]
        │
Backend agent (feature-developer)
   → API route + handlers.ts + Zod schema                      [needs types]
        │
   ┌────┴──────────────────┐
UI agent (ui-engineer)    Test agent (test-engineer)
   → components/hooks         → handler unit/integration tests [parallel]
   └────┬──────────────────┘
E2E (Playwright for the slice)                                 [needs UI]
```

**Phase-1 order**: Wave 0 (foundation + profiles + auth wiring; one DB agent) →
**Songs** → _human test_ → **Lessons + lesson_songs** → _human test_ →
**Assignments** → _human test_.

**Mechanism**: default is turn-by-turn `Agent` spawns so the user stays in the loop
between layers. A `Workflow()` pipeline can automate a single slice to its gate — opt-in.

---

## Verification

- **Per step**: `supabase db reset` on the local uwh stack (Docker must be running —
  it was down during analysis), then the step's gate test, then `npm test` + type regen.
- A **manual-test HTML** per the CLAUDE.md gate for each non-trivial migration.
- **End of Phase 1**: full `db reset` clean from empty → app signs in and does basic
  CRUD on all three tables; RLS spot-checked with teacher vs student accounts.

## Housekeeping (confirm at execution)

- Archive the remaining 6 `supabase/migrations/` files (and the already-moved 167 in
  `supabase/migrations_archive/`) — commit the archive, or delete outright since the
  baseline dump is the historical record.
- **No Cloud/prod changes** — this rebuild targets the local stack until a future,
  separate cutover decision.
