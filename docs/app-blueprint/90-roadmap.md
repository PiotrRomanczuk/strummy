# Implementation Roadmap

The ordered plan across every open gap in the blueprint. Each item is one line + a pointer to its
agent-executable brief in the owning domain doc. **No statuses here** — the vault
(`projects/Strummy/Strummy.md`) tracks what's in flight and done; when a gap ships, delete its
brief and its row here.

**Ordering principle** (grill-locked 2026-07-18): the self-host launch is the critical path — the
5 real students are the forcing function. v1 = trust pass: only correctness/honesty work ships
before launch; new student-facing features wait for real usage (v1.1). Debt interleaves only
where it de-risks launch.

## Tranche 1 — Self-host launch (critical path)

Procedure + hard gates: [92-launch-runbook.md](92-launch-runbook.md). Summary order:

1. P3 remaining: UPS + pull-the-plug test · external uptime monitor
2. P4 cutover: auth `config.toml` → OAuth to Production → Vercel env repoint → smoke →
   RLS cross-role suite vs StrummyProd
3. P5: dry-run throwaway student → invite the 5 real students

**DB-side fixes on the cutover window** (apply to StrummyProd while it has zero users — each
is a migration + test, small).

_Shipped 2026-07-19: PRA-1 (practice aggregate/undo triggers fixed + PRA-1 RLS-real test green
against live dev DB), NOT-1, ASG-3. Tranche 1's remaining scope is now purely the launch
procedure above (P3–P5), not code._

## Tranche 2 — v1 trust fixes (branch work, any time)

Correctness and honesty on surfaces students/teacher already use. No new features.

_Shipped 2026-07-27 (third pass — admin role, same branch): **sign-out never actually signed anyone
out** — the session is an SSR **cookie**, so `supabase.auth.signOut()` in the browser cleared
localStorage and left it intact; middleware kept seeing a valid session and bounced the user back,
meaning the next person on a shared machine was still signed in. Replaced with a server route
handler (`app/auth/signout/route.ts`) reached by plain navigation, verified by the cookie actually
disappearing · **the DB badge lied about which database you're on** — the host was hardcoded to
`localhost:54321` (the PRODUCTION port on this setup) while the app was on `192.168.1.75:55321`;
now sourced from `useDbConnection()`. Also verified: admin data scope (452 lessons across all
teachers, admin-only Teacher column) and pagination at scale (page 8 of 8 = exactly 32 rows)._

_Shipped 2026-07-27 (second pass — the thirteen gaps the first pass left open, same branch):
lessons list paginated (LES-4 — page 2+ were unreachable) · "Schedule lesson" from a student page
now carries the student (LES-5) · `999d` practice sentinel replaced with "never / no practice
logged yet" (PRA-4) · student-facing assignment copy de-teachered (ASG-5) · inbox given a sidebar
entry (NOT-4 — `NOTIFICATION_ITEM` was exported but mounted nowhere) · nested `<button>` in the
chat conversation list flattened (AIA-3) · nav active-state now defers to the most specific sibling
so only one item highlights, chips wrap instead of clipping (AIA-4) · student nav "My Songs" →
"Song Library" (SNG-6 — the route is the whole library) · `Select` triggers render their label
explicitly (UIX-1) · `--accent` retuned from crimson to a subtle gold surface so dropdown
highlights stop reading as destructive (UIX-2)._

_Also found and fixed during that pass (not previously filed): every AI call still failed after the
`:free` fix because the chat path set **no** `max_tokens` and OpenRouter reserved the model's
65536-token maximum — capped at 2048, and **AI now works end-to-end** · date/time rendering pinned
to an explicit locale in 11 components (a bare `toLocaleDateString()` follows the runtime's locale
and was throwing a React hydration error on every repertoire card)._

_Closed on inspection, no code needed: **NOT-5** ("Enable All" reads off while children are on) —
correct behaviour; two preferences in other categories genuinely were off, and the switch spans all 17. A count ("15 of 17 on") was added so it can't be misread again. **ADM-4** (API-keys table forces
page scroll) — measured: the table scrolls inside its own `overflow-x: auto` container (715px in a
622px wrapper) and the page does not scroll horizontally at all. **THY-2** (theory unreachable) —
`theory` is in `CORE_LOOP_HIDDEN_ITEMS`, deliberately, and already commented as such._

_Shipped 2026-07-27 (first pass, click-through audit, branch `fix/teacher-audit-findings`): lesson
status filter matched nothing (upper-case column vs lower-case param) · filter chip counts derived
from the truncated result set (new `getLessonsBreakdown`) · "Repeat weekly" silently discarded
duration/format/notes/status · all AI features dead on retired OpenRouter `:free` slugs (single
`resolveOpenRouterModel` normaliser; **now bills the paid tier**, opt-out via
`OPENROUTER_ALLOW_PAID=false`) · a student could mint a live API key (UI gate + server-side guard) ·
sign-out hung forever with no timeout, all roles · AI Chat failed silently with an empty bubble ·
student saw their own name as the lesson counterparty · teacher could start an assigned chord drill
but never save it · "Schedule post" accepted a fully empty form · homework "+ Add" dropped the
lesson's student · edit-lesson badge read "4/3" · two empty states pointed at controls/screens that
don't exist · dev quick-login constant had drifted from the dev DB._

_Shipped 2026-07-19: IDA-3 (LockedAccountsCard mounted on the admin dashboard), ADM-1
(SystemLogsTable restored at `/dashboard/logs`), CAL-2 (calendar un-hidden from nav — not in
`CORE_LOOP_HIDDEN_ITEMS`), LES-1/LES-2/IDA-5/ASG-1 (stub routes deleted), NOT-2 (inbox/bell
paths unified onto `in-app-notification-service.ts`)._

## Tranche 3 — v1.1 parking lot (deliberately blocked on real usage)

Do **not** build before the 5 students have produced usage data. Briefs exist so any item can
start the day it's unblocked.

**First slice (grill 2026-07-22).** When v1.1 unblocks, the _first_ thing to build is the
**chord-quiz surfacing bundle — CHT-1 + CHT-2 + ASG-4** (assignable chord drills): it's the only
nav-hidden learning tool both ship-ready and result-producing, so it's the tracer bullet for the
whole "surface what's hidden" effort. Theory (THY-1) trails it (blocked on content authoring); the
fretboard has no teacher-visible result to weave. This does **not** relax the gate above — the
bundle still waits for real usage data before it starts.

_Shipped ahead of schedule 2026-07-19: IDA-4 (onboarding `user_preferences` now surfaced on the
student detail view) — landed alongside the Tranche 2 sweep rather than waiting for v1.1 usage
data._

_Shipped 2026-07-19: AIA-1 (Ollama fallback model pinned, `ai-agents-e2e` repaired), SNG-5
(`student_song_progress` dropped), IDA-1 (`user_settings` retired), LES-3/CAL-3 (recurring
lesson creation wired + recurring-import dedupe tested against the real DB), Hooks
(`useAIStream`/lesson-form hooks both now under the 150-line rule), and the Lighthouse
audit/Bruno drift audit/Jest quarantine drain parts of "Repo" (quarantine mechanism removed
from `jest.config.ts` entirely)._

## Tranche 5 — Parked / backlog

Marketing tooling and admin niceties; revisit when the need is active, not before.

_Shipped 2026-07-19: CNT-1 (ProductionTab re-enabled), ADM-2/ADM-3 (dead audit_log read
dropped · debug dashboard mounted), AIA-2 (`is_helpful` feedback buttons wired), ASG-2
(assignment_history surfaced as a detail timeline), IDA-2 (avatar storage upload)._

## Cross-cutting — SaaS hygiene (external benchmark, 2026-07-20)

From benchmarking Strummy against a generic Supabase + Next.js SaaS starter
([Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template](https://github.com/Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template)). These
are table-stakes the template bundles that Strummy skipped — **not** grill-locked, so the owner
decides placement against the launch critical path. Full briefs:

## Open questions (cross-doc index)

Each domain doc keeps its own `## Open questions`; the grill-worthy ones as of 2026-07-18:
student-facing AI ever (08) · `drive_files`/`song_videos` unification (09) ·
streak/achievement design set (04) · `chord_id` orphan risk (05) · ComingSoonCard vs trust pass
(03).
