# E2E Journey Catalog — Admin & Student

A complete inventory of the user journeys needed to fully cover Strummy by E2E, for the
two roles: **Admin/Teacher** and **Student**. Each journey names the route/action it
drives, the capability or RLS rule it proves, and its current coverage status — so the
gaps are obvious.

UI journeys (browser-drivable by Playwright) are listed in full. **Backend dataflow
journeys** (calendar sync, shadow→claim, notification pipeline) are listed separately in
[Part D](#part-d--backend-dataflow-journeys-integration-test-candidates) — they need
mocked Google/email and belong in the Jest integration layer, not Playwright.

Derived from the live `app/dashboard/*` routes, the existing Playwright suite
(`tests/e2e/*`, ~19 specs / ~150 tests), and the per-role CRUD rules + dataflow traces now
folded into the blueprint domain docs ([`../00-overview.md`](../00-overview.md),
[`../01-identity-access.md`](../01-identity-access.md),
[`../02-lessons-calendar.md`](../02-lessons-calendar.md),
[`../07-notifications-email.md`](../07-notifications-email.md)).

## Conventions

- **Roles**: `Admin` (== Teacher in the current UI — the owner is the sole teacher;
  admin-only surfaces are flagged), `Student`.
- **Coverage legend**: ✅ covered · 🟡 partial · ❌ gap · ⏸ stub / "coming soon"
  (smoke-only, don't deep-test).
- **Test accounts** (local Supabase, non-demo → **not** mutation-guarded):
  - Admin: `p.romanczuk@gmail.com` / `test123_admin`
  - Teacher: `teacher@example.com` / `test123_teacher`
  - Student: `student1@example.com` / `test123_student`
  - Demo accounts (`sarah@`/`emma@`, `Demo2024!`) are `is_development:true` → mutations
    blocked by `guardTestAccountMutation`; reserved for the demo-guard suite.
- **Helpers to reuse**:
  - `tests/helpers/auth.ts` — `loginAsAdmin` / `loginAsTeacher` / `loginAsStudent`
  - `tests/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts` — session-cached `loginAs(role)`
  - `tests/helpers/form.ts` — `fillLessonForm`, `fillFormField`, `verifyToast`
  - `tests/helpers/dashboard.ts` — `expectNavItemVisible` / `expectNavItemHidden`
  - `tests/helpers/cleanup.ts` — E2E-prefixed teardown

## Coverage summary

- **Total journeys catalogued**: ~70 (Admin ~38, Student ~24, Cross-role ~6, Dataflow ~6).
- **Already covered (✅)**: ~22 — auth baseline, song/lesson/assignment CRUD (teacher),
  student read-only enforcement + status transitions, AI generation, dashboard cards/sidebar,
  demo mutation guards, mobile/responsive, core integration workflows.
- **Partial (🟡)**: ~8 — sign-out, inline shadow create, list filters, notification prefs,
  cross-role isolation.
- **Top gaps (❌) worth filling first**: Practice (B6), Repertoire (B7), Notifications inbox
  (A10.1 / B8.4), Settings & API keys (A10.3 / B8.3), Lesson song-status transitions (A4.3),
  Assignment templates (A5.3), Account lockout & password reset (A1.3 / A1.4), User edit +
  repertoire management (A6.4 / A6.5).

## PART D — Backend dataflow journeys (integration-test candidates)

> These need mocked Google OAuth/Calendar and an email sink, so they belong in the Jest
> integration layer (`npm run test:integration` / `npm run test:rls`), **not** Playwright.
> Listed here so "whole application" coverage is honest about what UI E2E can't reach.
> Full traces live in the blueprint domain docs (02 calendar sync, 01 shadow claim,
> 07 notification pipeline).

## Next steps

Implementing the ❌ gaps is follow-up work, best sliced per domain into separate PRs
(Practice, Repertoire, Notifications/Settings, Lesson song-status, Templates, Auth
recovery). Each new spec should reuse the helpers above and the non-demo test accounts,
and respect the login rate-limiter (reuse `tests/.auth/*.json` sessions; don't clear
between runs). See the CRUD rule of thumb in
[`../00-overview.md`](../00-overview.md) §Roles and each blueprint domain doc's
Behavior & rules for the per-entity CRUD rules each journey asserts.
