# Ship Workflow

Execute the complete shipping workflow for the current branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for these flags:
- `--patch` / `--minor` / `--major` — version label override
- `--quick` — fast path: equivalent to `--skip-review --skip-linear`
- `--skip-linear` — skip Linear update in Phase 5
- `--skip-review` — skip code review in Phase 3
- `--dry-run` — run validation phases, print what push/PR would do, don't execute

If `--quick` is set, enable both `--skip-review` and `--skip-linear`.

---

## Mode Selection

**Full mode** (default): Phases 1–6
**Quick mode** (`--quick`): Phases 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (skips review + Linear)

**IMPORTANT**: Execute each phase sequentially. **Stop immediately** if any phase fails. Do NOT proceed past a failed gate.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

Run ALL checks. No interactive prompts. Fail fast.

1. `git branch --show-current` — if on `main`, `master`, or `production` → **ABORT**: "Create a feature branch first: `git checkout -b feature/STRUM-XXX-description`"
2. `git status --porcelain` — if any output → **ABORT**: "Commit or stash changes before running /ship"
3. `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` — if zero commits → **ABORT**: "No commits to ship"
4. Extract Linear ticket ID from branch name (regex: `STRUM-\d+`). Store if found; no warning if missing.

```
Pre-flight:
  Branch:  feature/STRUM-123-add-reminders ✓
  Clean:   no uncommitted changes ✓
  Commits: 3 ahead of main ✓
  Ticket:  STRUM-123
```

---

## Phase 2: Unit Tests (MANDATORY — both modes)

```bash
npm test
```

- On failure: report failing tests and **STOP**
- On success: report count, continue

```
Tests: PASSED (XX suites, XX tests)
```

---

## Phase 3: Code Review (skipped if `--skip-review` or `--quick`)

If skipped, print "Code review: skipped" and continue to Phase 4.

Otherwise, run `/code-review --scope quick` inline:

```
Skill: code-review, args: "--scope quick"
```

Interpret the verdict:
- `CLEAN` or `HAS_SUGGESTIONS` → print summary, continue
- `HAS_BLOCKERS` → print findings, **STOP**

```
Review: CLEAN (or: HAS_SUGGESTIONS — N suggestions, 0 blockers)
```

---

## Phase 4: Push to Remote

If `--dry-run`: print "Would push to origin/{branch}" and skip to Phase 5.

1. Check upstream: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null`
2. If no upstream: `git push -u origin {branch}`
3. If upstream exists: `git push`

Pre-push hook runs lint + tsc automatically. If it fails → **STOP** and report errors.

---

## Phase 5: Create PR + Version Label + Linear

If `--dry-run`: print what PR would be created with what labels, then skip to Phase 6.

### Version detection (inline)

Priority order:
1. `--major` flag → `major`
2. `--minor` flag → `minor`
3. `--patch` flag → `patch`
4. Branch prefix `feature/` or `feat/` → `minor`
5. Branch prefix `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `test/`, `docs/` → `patch`
6. Default → `patch`

### Create PR

Generate title and body from commits:

```bash
# Gather data
COMMITS=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --pretty=format:"- %s")
DIFFSTAT=$(git diff origin/main..HEAD --stat)
```

Title: `[STRUM-XXX] Description from branch slug` (or just the description if no ticket)

```bash
gh pr create --title "{title}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
{bullet list from commits}

## Changes
{diff stat summary}

{Closes STRUM-XXX — if ticket found}

## Quality
- Tests: {count} passing
- Code review: {verdict or "skipped"}
- Lint + TSC: Verified (pre-push hook)

)"
```

### Add version label

```bash
gh pr edit {number} --add-label "version:{type}"
```

### Linear update (unless `--skip-linear` or `--quick`)

If a `STRUM-XXX` ticket was found:
1. Use Linear MCP `get_issue` to fetch the issue
2. Use `update_issue` to set state to "In Review"
3. Use `create_comment` to add PR link

If skipped or no ticket: note in summary.

---

## Phase 6: Post-ship Summary

```
Ship complete!
  Branch:   feature/STRUM-XXX-description
  PR:       https://github.com/...
  Version:  minor (auto-bumped on merge)
  Linear:   STRUM-XXX → In Review (or: skipped)
  Quality:  tests ✓ | review {verdict/skipped} | lint+tsc ✓ (hook)
```

If `--quick` was used, append:
```
  Note: Quick mode — code review and Linear update were skipped
```

---

## Dry Run Mode (`--dry-run`)

- Phases 1–3: run normally (pre-flight, tests, review)
- Phases 4–5: print what **would** happen, do NOT execute
- Phase 6: print summary noting dry run

---

## Error Recovery

If any phase fails:
- Print which phase failed and why
- Print what was already completed
- Do NOT rollback completed steps
- Suggest the fix and tell the user to re-run `/ship` after fixing
